        Tufts University is a place that highly prices the importance of incorporating events held by organizations outside of the school to create a more diversified environment. Being a member of such community, I dearly enjoy the opportunities of organizing and participating in events like Hackathons and competitions held by Harvard and MIT to not just bring our ideas out to the world, but also expand our own community by letting some of the leading practices in the technology reach our students.

        As one of the founding members of a startup company with which we won the first price at the MIT startup competition, I realized the significance of creating and maintaining opportunities like this to bridge academia with the industry. Instead of hosting our website on Heroku and Firebase, we keep our site running on an Elastic Beanstalk instance provided by Amazon Web Services(AWS), an decision made after talking to one of the app hosting engineer who used Heroku in the beginning and had to refactor the entire architecture of their backend to incorporate AWS services when the user base got bigger.

        I believe that solely learning knowledge, while fundamental and indispensable, is far from enough as the world keeps changing. Theoretical knowledge needs to be backed up with the most up-to-date practices and technology in the industry. Events like Hackathon provide colleges students chances to get to know some of the cutting edge products and eventually being able to make amazing products on their own with these valuable experiences.
